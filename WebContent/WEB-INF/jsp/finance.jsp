            <h3>What is Energy Efficiency?</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/chart_pic.gif" alt="" width="275" height="150" />
            <p>
                Energy efficiency, sometimes called efficient energy use, is using less energy to 
                provide the same level of performance, comfort, and convenience.  For example, an 
                energy efficient compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) uses 85% less energy than a 
                conventional incandescent bulb to produce the same amount of light.  
                <br></br>
                Simply put, it is an energy efficient home that uses less energy and is more comfortable 
                and healthier than before.  With today's technologies and professional services, just about 
                every home's energy use can be improved in an affordable way.

            <h3>How Do I Make My Home More Energy Efficient?</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/solar-diagram4.gif" alt="" width="275" height="175" />
            <p>
                Any home improvements performed to reduce your overall energy consumption or prevent 
                unwanted energy loss contribute to better home energy efficiency. Related to heating 
                & cooling - this includes weatherization steps such as better insulating or sealing 
                your home, replacing older windows & doors, maintaining sealed heating & cooling ducts 
                and clean filters, and upgrading outdated heating & cooling systems, air conditioners 
                and ventilation fans. Other changes to improve the energy efficiency of your home include 
                switching to energy efficient ENERGY STAR rated appliances, lighting, and electronics.  
                Also, today there are solar electric, solar hot water, wind turbines, and fuel cell products 
                that can drastically reduce the direct energy consumption of your home and make sense for homes 
                in most areas of the country.

            <h1>Financing Options</h1>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/Financing_energy_products.gif" alt="" width="275" height="175" />
            <h3>Financing Your Renewable Energy System</h3>
            <p>
                Installing residential renewable energy systems, such as solar panels, wind turbines 
                or fuel cells, can be a significant investment. Typical costs for such systems may range 
                from $10,000 to $50,000. To purchase the system outright, there are a number of options: 
                cash, home equity loans or personal/private loans.
                <br></br>
                If purchasing a system is too significant of an investment, there are two other incredibly 
                economic ways to install a system in your home: leasing and purchase power agreements.
                No matter what financing mechanism you end up choosing, adding a renewable energy system 
                is beneficial in so many different ways but what is most attractive is that over time, the
                implementing such as system can potentially cost you nothing. How is that possible? The benefit 
                of installing a renewable energy system on your home is that you produce your own energy and are 
                no longer purchasing it from your utility provider. When you finance a renewable energy system, 
                the cost is your monthly payment. Depending on where you live, the size of your electric bill and 
                other factors, it is very possible that the amount you save on your electric bill is more than your 
                monthly financing payment for the renewable energy system.

		<h1>Project Financing</h1>
        <p>NRGSavers possesses the financial capabilities and expertise to structure innovative lighting program 
            financing models that enable energy efficiency projects to be implemented with no initial capital 
            requirement. Examples of program alternatives are show below.</p> 
        </div>
         <!-- ********************************* -->
        <div>
        <h3>Paid from Savings Program</h3>
        <p>A monthly payment plan is designed so that the monthly payment is less than the monthly savings 
            creating a positive cash flow immediately. The initial payment is deferred until a month after 
            the completion of the project. Therefore, when energy savings achieved during the installation 
            phase is considered more than a month of savings has accrued thus providing an initial reserve 
            for repayment. Further, the savings are verified with digital watt meter readings and amp meters 
            ensuring the cash flow will be realized. </p>
        </div>
         <!-- ********************************* -->
        <div>
        <h3>Efficiency Made Easy</h3>
        <p>Constellation Energy has selected NRGSavers as a Channel Partner to offer and implement their 
            new Efficiency Made Easy program (EME). EME bundles fixed price electricity (+3 yrs) with energy 
            conservation measures, such as lighting retrofits. Customers pay for the cost of the energy 
            conservation measures as part of their per kWh commodity charge over the length of the contract. 
            There's no upfront capital or financing required, and customers retain the benefit of the installed
            energy efficiency measures at the end of the commodity contract. </p>
        </div>
         <!-- ********************************* -->
        <div>
        <p>NRGSavers was chosen based on their outstanding customer service and more than twenty years 
            lighting upgrade experience.</p>
            </div>
         <!-- ********************************* -->
        <div>
<h3>Zero Percent Financing</h3>
        <p>Special utility incentive programs are often structured with 0% financing in order to fulfill 
            energy efficiency mandates. NRGSavers possesses strong multilateral relationship with utilities
            across the country and will help its clients navigate and obtain maximum available funds under 
            subsidized financing rates. NRGSavers keeps abreast of changes in the availability of funds.  
            Please inquire to see if your facility qualifies for zero percent financing for your energy 
            project. Monthly payments are structured to be less than monthly savings creating positive cash 
            flow immediately.</p>
</div>
         <!-- ********************************* -->
        <div>
        <h3>Energy Performance Lease</h3>
        <p>NRGSavers possesses relationships with several leading finance companies offering low cost lease 
            alternatives where projects are structured to provide monthly energy savings in excess of monthly
            lease payments thereby creating immediate positive cash flow from investing in lighting upgrade 
            projects.</p>

        <h2>Direct Purchase Options Include Cash, Financing & Loans</h2>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Cash</h3>
        <p>Since putting in a renewable energy system can cost tens of thousands of dollars, a direct
            purchase using cash requires significant disposable income or savings. If you are able to 
            pay cash or a portion of the system in cash and avoid interest payments, you will experience 
            substantial and immediate savings on your new renewable energy system.  If you don't have the 
            upfront cash, don't worry, there are other options including financing & loans, leasing & power 
            purchase agreements, and government tax programs (PACE) - which are described in more detail below</p>
        <br></br>
        <img class="imgr" src="images/equity_loans.gif" alt="" width="250" height="175" />
        <h3>Home Equity Loans</h3>
        <p>For many homeowners, a home equity loan, or borrowing against the equity of your home, is another option 
            for financing a renewable energy system. Since you are borrowing against the equity of your home, you are 
            essentially tacking the renewable energy system onto your existing mortgage. We recommend a home equity 
            mortgage only if you have ample equity in your home and do not plan to sell for the next 12-24 months 
            (or more). In addition, if you are struggling to make payments on your existing mortgage or have a credit 
            score lower than 640, this is probably not the best option for you. However, please remember that adding 
            a renewable energy system to your home not only lowers your utility bills but can also increase the value 
            of your home and increase its re-salability. </p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Personal/Private Loans</h3>
        <p>Personal loans are typically just private loans from either banks or other private entities. 
            Personal loans are generally tougher to obtain and require a minimum of verification including 
            residence, income, and employment and they also come with a higher interest rate than most other 
            loans, including home equity loans. </p>
<br></br>
<img class="imgr" src="images/ppa.gif" alt="" width="250" height="175" />
        <h3>Power Purchase Agreement</h3>
        <p>A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is similar to a lease and has been a popular method of 
            financing solar power systems for many years.  In fact, major corporations often use PPAs
            to put solar systems on their buildings.  </p>
