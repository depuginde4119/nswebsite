           NRG Savers has provided us the roadmap towards energy efficiency and an overall more sustainable building.  With their comprehensive 
           energy audit, they located sources of wasted energy and utility cost savings. Additionally, with their sustainable retrofit implementation plan, 
           JTRL has given us specific methods to increase building performance (for the Simone Hotel a 123 unit multifamily building), while providing 
           a healthier place for our residents to live.- <b>Claritta Mena</b>

            service and excellent advice and direction. I recommend them to anyone, who wants to improve the quality of their home, use less energy to heat 
            and cool their house, and save money. Performing energy assessments at your home and business help you do more with less, an essential idea in the coming years.- <b>Bill Nye</b>, The Science Guy
