            <h3>Wastewater Solutions</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/prof_wasteWater.gif" alt="" width="275" height="175" />
            <p>
                Our water treatment solutions range from membrane filtration systems to treat and desalinate water and media filtration and clarification systems to UV and ozone systems to disinfect water and analytical instruments to measure, monitor and test the quality of water. 
                <br></br>
                Our wastewater treatment solutions include Xylem pumps to move wastewater and advanced mixer, aeration, sequence batch reactor and membrane bioreactor systems to ozone and ultraviolet disinfection systems, media filtration, tertiary treatment and more to treat wastewater.

            <h3>Heat Pumps</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/prof_heatPumps.gif" alt="" width="275" height="175" />
            <p>
                For climates with moderate heating and cooling needs, heat pumps offer an energy-efficient alternative to furnaces and air conditioners. Like your refrigerator, heat pumps use electricity to move heat from a  cool space to a warm space, making the cool space cooler and the warm
 space warmer. During the heating season, heat pumps move heat from the cool outdoors into your warm house and during the cooling season, heat  pumps move heat from your cool house into the warm outdoors. Because they move heat rather than generate heat, heat pumps can provide equivalent space conditioning at as little as one quarter of the cost of operating conventional heating or cooling appliances.

            <h3>Gardening</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/prof_gardening.gif" alt="" width="275" height="175" />
            <p>
                Outdoor spaces, like grassy yards or cultivated gardens, are by
                definition "green." Having a green landscape at your house or office building is a small step towards being more sustainable and supporting the environmental conservation movement. While you may not consider 
                your outdoor space in this light, you do, hopefully, enjoy it for what it is - a simple green space that is your own.<br></br>
                However, when you realize its greater potential, you can see what else your yard has to offer. Your yard and gardens can be landscaped into an energy efficient space. When designed well, your yard actually 
                has the capability to improve your home's use of energy, as well as, be 
                a space you enjoy.
            </p>

            <h3>Air Conditioning</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/prof_airConditioning.gif" alt="" width="275" height="175" />
            <p>
                Because our systems help you reduce your energy consumption in your ome, you are doing your part to leave less of a footprint on the 
                environment, all while saving money on your energy bill. <br></br>
                NRG Savers embraces the Environmental Vision 2021  initiative, which sets dramatic goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (for example: reducing Carbon Dioxide emissions from product 
                usage by 30%), recycling resources, and raising environmental awareness by 2021. It should be noted that while many corporations are joining the "green" movement today, the Environmental Vision 2021 initiative was
                created by NRG Savers in 1991 as a thirty-year effort.
