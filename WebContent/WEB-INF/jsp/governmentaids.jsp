        <h2>Take Advantage of New Government Sponsored Financing to Get Your Solar Power System Today!</h2>

            <h3>What is PACE?</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/pace.gif" alt="" width="375" height="175" />
            <p>
                This year, a new and potentially game changing solar financing mechanism called 
                Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) was approved. Through the American Recovery 
                and Reinvestment Act, the U.S. government has authorized up to $453 million in 
                competitive grants for state and local governments to help promote the purchase and 
                adoption of solar systems and implement PACE programs
                <br></br>
                With PACE, city governments issue municipal bonds in order to give out loans to 
                home or building owners to finance the purchase of a solar power system for their 
                building. The property owner then pays the cost of that loan (with a competitive 
                rate of interest) over 15 to 20 years through an increase in the respective buildings 
                property taxes.  
            </p>

            <h3>Federal Tax Credit</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/cash.gif" alt="" width="375" height="175" />
            <p>
                The federal government allows you to deduct 30% of your solar system costs off your 
                federal taxes through an investment tax credit.  The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is 
                effective through December 31, 2016.  The ITC reduces the overall tax liability for 
                individuals or businesses that make investments in renewable energy technologies.

            <h3>Solar Rebates and Incentives</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/dp.gif" alt="" width="275" height="275" />
            <p>
                Established in 1995, the most comprehensive database of state and federal incentives 
                is the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE), funded by 
                the U.S. Department of Energy?s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).
                To learn more about state specific rebates and incentives, visit the DSIRE website.

            <h3>State Rebate Programs</h3>
            <img class="imgr" src="images/product.gif" alt="" width="375" height="175" />
            <p>
                The rebates are government incentives but are structured to simply pay you cash as 
                an incentive to buy a product, in this case energy efficient products. Once you can 
                prove that you purchased a rebate eligible product, typically you send in proof of 
                that purchase to the relevant state agency administering the rebate program and they 
                will issue your cash rebate. Often times, the rebate is large and can offset almost 
                half of the purchase price of the eligible energy efficient product.
